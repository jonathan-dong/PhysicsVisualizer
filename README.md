# PhysicsVisualizer

Welcome to Physics Visualizer! I built this application because I wanted to combine my interests in Physics and Computer Science. I hope that you can enjoy messing around with some of the physical systems and maybe even learn a bit about physics, math, or computer programming. You can access it here: https://jonathan-dong.github.io/PhysicsVisualizer/

I will continue to add more systems whenever I can make the time. 

## Systems

**Double Pendulum**

**Spring Pendulum**

**Lorenz System**
